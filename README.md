# Stock Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation for **Task 5: Stock Price Prediction**, completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Learnflow Services**. 

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that forecasts stock prices using historical market data. This notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to generate accurate stock price predictions.

## 📁 File Details

- **Filename**: `stock_price_model_code.ipynb`  
- **Contents**: Step-by-step code for:
  1. Loading and cleaning historical market data.
  2. Feature engineering and selection.
  3. Model training and evaluation using machine learning algorithms.
  4. Insights into stock trends and prediction accuracy.

## 🔧 Key Tools and Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or others based on exploration).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² for performance assessment.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Leverage historical data to predict future stock prices.  
2. Optimize model performance for real-world forecasting challenges.
